# Scripts to automate picture/photo management
Couple of scripts (in Python) to manage pictures:

First script:
sortPhotos.py
> To be launched right after having downloaded pictures from digital camera (aims to organize raw files in a separated folder, group set of pictures in folder, geo-tags pictures if a .gpx file is given, especially for future panorama assembly)

createPanorama.py
> automates assembly of panorama from files in a folder (script performs some actions that are generally done manually in Hugin to create a panorama). Result is without waranty but at least should give a decent draft)
